The core version of the Norwegian Climate Cen- ter‚Äôs Earth System Model, named NorESM1-M, is presented. The NorESM family of models are based on the Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4) of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, but differs from the latter by, in particular, an isopycnic coordinate ocean model and advanced chemistry‚Äìaerosol‚Äìcloud‚Äìradiation interaction schemes. NorESM1-M has a horizontal resolution of approx- imately 2‚ó¶ for the atmosphere and land components and 1‚ó¶ for the ocean and ice components. NorESM is also available in a lower resolution version (NorESM1-L) and a version that includes prognostic biogeochemical cycling (NorESM1- ME). The latter two model conÔ¨Ågurations are not part of this paper. Here, a Ô¨Årst-order assessment of the model stability, the mean model state and the internal variability based on the model experiments made available to CMIP5 are pre- sented. Further analysis of the model performance is pro- vided in an accompanying paper (Iversen et al., 2013), pre- senting the corresponding climate response and scenario pro- jections made with NorESM1-M.\\n\\n1\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nIn the following, the Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM) is presented. NorESM is a nationally coordinated effort, building on the heritage of the research project Reg- Clim (1997‚Äì2006; Iversen, 2008), the development of the Bergen Climate Model (BCM; Furevik et al., 2003; OtterÀöa et al., 2009, 2010) at the Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research in Bergen, and aerosol‚Äìcloud‚Äìradiation interaction schemes developed in Oslo (Seland et al., 2008; Storelvmo et al., 2006; KirkevÀöag et al., 2008b; Kristj¬¥ansson et al., 2005; Hoose et al., 2009).\\n\\nDespite the nationally coordinated effort, Norway has in- sufÔ¨Åcient expertise and manpower to develop, test, verify and maintain a complete earth system model. For this rea- son, NorESM is based on the Community Climate Sys- tem Model version 4 (CCSM4; Gent et al., 2011; Verten- stein et al., 2010) operated at the National Center for At- mospheric Research on behalf of the Community Climate System Model (CCSM)/Community Earth System Model (CESM) project of the University Corporation for Atmo- spheric Research. NorESM is, however, more than a model ‚Äúdialect‚Äù of CCSM4. Notably, NorESM differs from CCSM4 in the following aspects: NorESM utilises an isopycnic coordinate ocean general circulation model developed in\\n\\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\\n\\n688\\n\\nM. Bentsen et al.: The Norwegian Earth System Model, NorESM1-M\\n\\nBergen during the last decade (e.g. Bentsen et al., 2004; Drange et al., 2005b; Lohman et al., 2009; Orre et al., 2010), originating from the Miami Isopycnic Coordinate Ocean Model (MICOM) (Bleck et al., 1992). The atmo- spheric module is modiÔ¨Åed with chemistry‚Äìaerosol‚Äìcloud‚Äì radiation interaction schemes developed for the Oslo ver- sion of the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM4-Oslo; KirkevÀöag et al., 2013). Finally, the HAMburg Ocean Car- bon Cycle (HAMOCC) model developed at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, Hamburg (Maier-Reimer, 1993; Maier-Reimer et al., 2005), adapted to an isopycnic ocean model framework, constitutes the core of the biogeochemical ocean module in NorESM (Tjiputra et al., 2010). In this way NorESM adds to the much desired climate model diversity, and thus to the hierarchy of models participating in phase 5 of the Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5; Moss et al., 2010; Taylor et al., 2012). In this and in an ac- companying paper (Iversen et al., 2013), NorESM without biogeochemical cycling is presented. The reader is referred to Assmann et al. (2010) and Tjiputra et al. (2013) for a de- scription of the biogeochemical ocean component and carbon cycle version of NorESM, respectively.\\n\\nThere are several overarching objectives underlying the development of NorESM. Western Scandinavia and the sur- rounding seas are located in the midst of the largest surface temperature anomaly on earth (Drange et al., 2005a), gov- erned by anomalously large oceanic and atmospheric heat transports (Seager et al., 2002; Shaffrey and Sutton, 2006; Jungclaus and Koenigk, 2010). Small changes to these trans- ports may result in large and abrupt changes in the local cli- mate. To better understand the variability and stability of the climate system, detailed studies of the formation, propaga- tion and decay of thermal and (oceanic) fresh water anoma- lies are required. Only a community effort bridging obser- vations, theory and modelling can signiÔ¨Åcantly advance our understanding on these issues.\\n\\nlike NorESM, may or may not belong to the preferred set of models for studying speciÔ¨Åc climate phenomena, like cli- mate variability and changes at high latitudes. Deep insight into one or several models is nevertheless a prerequisite to fully acknowledge both opportunities and limitations when analysing the available suite of model output. In this way, NorESM is an advanced tool for earth system researchers.\\n\\nThe present paper provides a general description and basic evaluation of the atmosphere‚Äìsea-ice‚Äìocean part of NorESM. Particular focus is put on the simulated clima- tology, stability and internal variability deduced from the model‚Äôs control and historical simulations. An accompany- ing paper (Iversen et al., 2013) presents the climate response and scenario projections, mainly based on analysis of the var- ious CMIP5 scenario integrations made with NorESM.\\n\\nCurrently, NorESM exists in three versions. The model version presented here is the Ô¨Årst version of the model with intermediate resolution, labelled NorESM1-M. Intermediate resolution is in this context a horizontal resolution of ap- proximately 2‚ó¶ for atmosphere and land components and 1‚ó¶ for ocean and ice components. For brevity, NorESM is used throughout this paper. NorESM is also available in a lower resolution version, labelled NorESM1-L. The latter version is primarily tailored for millennium-scale simulations of past climate (Zhang et al., 2012). Finally, the above-mentioned version of NorESM that includes biogeochemical cycling, in particular the cycling of carbon, is labelled NorESM1-ME.\\n\\nThe paper is organised as follows. In Sect. 2, a general overview of NorESM is provided, elaborating on similari- ties and, in particular, differences between NorESM and the parent CCSM4. In Sect. 3, the design of the various model experiments is presented. The following two sections fo- cus on the long-term model stability and model mean state. Key modes of simulated internal variability are discussed in Sect. 6. Section 7 is devoted to the simulated 21st century climate, and the paper is summarised in Sect. 8.\\n\\nThere are also many unresolved questions related to the unprecedented warming and sea ice loss in the Arctic ob- served during the last decades (Bo¬¥e et al., 2009; Stroeve et al., 2012; ÀöArthun et al., 2012), and how these changes may inÔ¨Çuence the generated modes of variability and long-term changes in the region. A state-of-the-art model system will contribute to address these changes.\\n\\nCentral to the NorESM activity is therefore improvement, implementation and veriÔ¨Åcation of climate processes that are of particular importance at high (northern) latitudes, and con- sequently for polar climate. As the tropics are of key impor- tance for global heat and moisture budgets, as well as for generating and inÔ¨Çuencing major climate variability modes, analysis of climate feedbacks, responses and sensitivities of low-latitude climate are an inherent part of the activity.\\n\\n2 Model description\\n\\nNorESM is, as mentioned above, largely based on CCSM4. The main differences are the isopycnic coordinate ocean module in NorESM and that CAM4-Oslo substitutes CAM4 as the atmosphere module. The sea ice and land models in NorESM are basically the same as in CCSM4 and the Com- munity Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1), except that deposited soot and mineral dust aerosols on snow and sea ice are based on the aerosol calculations in CAM4-Oslo.\\n\\n2.1 Atmospheric component\\n\\nSeveral studies show that the optimal, or ‚Äúbest‚Äù, climate model is not an individual model but the ensemble mean of all available models (e.g. Reichler and Kim, 2008), possi- bly excluding apparent model outliers. An individual model,\\n\\nCAM4-Oslo is a version of CAM4 (Neale et al., 2010, 2013) with parameterizations of aerosols, aerosol‚Äìradiation and aerosol‚Äìcloud interactions originally developed for use in Community Climate Model‚ÄìOslo (CCM-Oslo). With respect\\n\\nGeosci. Model Dev., 6, 687‚Äì720, 2013\\n\\nwww.geosci-model-dev.net/6/687/2013/\\n\\nM. Bentsen et al.: The Norwegian Earth System Model, NorESM1-M\\n\\n689\\n\\nto physics, CAM4-Oslo applies the standard conÔ¨Åguration of CAM4, e.g. the Rasch and Kristj¬¥ansson (1998) scheme for stratiform cloud processes and the CAM-RT radiation scheme, which were both also used in CAM3 (Collins et al., 2006). As in CAM4, deep convective clouds are parameter- ized following Zhang and McFarlane (1995) extended with the plume dilution and convective momentum transport also used in CCSM4 (Richter and Rasch, 2008; Neale et al., 2008). We use the Ô¨Ånite volume dynamical core for transport calculations (Rasch et al., 2006) with horizontal resolution of 1.9‚ó¶ latitude by 2.5‚ó¶ longitude (in short referred to as 2‚ó¶ resolution) and with 26 levels in the vertical with a hybrid sigma-pressure co-ordinate and model top at 2.917 hPa. The horizontal grid mesh size is double that of the standard ver- sion used in CCSM4 (Gent et al., 2011).\\n\\nThe modelling of aerosol processes in CAM4-Oslo (KirkevÀöag et al., 2013) is extended from versions of CAM-Oslo described by Seland et al. (2008), KirkevÀöag et al. (2008b), Storelvmo et al. (2006), Hoose et al. (2009), and Struthers et al. (2011). Apart from a few modiÔ¨Åcations of the parameter tuning for cloud micro- and macrophysics, described and discussed in Sect. 3, the changes we have in- troduced to arrive at CAM4-Oslo are all related to aerosols and their interactions with radiation and cloud microphysics. The most important changes with respect to anthropogenic impacts on climate are the inclusion of biogenic primary organics and methane sulfonic acid from oceans, as well as a nearly doubled production of land-based biogenic sec- ondary organic aerosols compared to KirkevÀöag et al. (2008b). This increased abundance of natural organic matter has con- tributed to a considerable decrease of the indirect radiative forcing by anthropogenic aerosols in the model. Compared to year 1850, KirkevÀöag et al. (2013) estimated a change in indirect radiative forcing of ‚àí0.9 W m‚àí2 at year 2000 and ‚àí1.2 W m‚àí2 at year 2006. These values are closer to the estimate by the IPCC fourth assessment report (AR4) of ‚àí0.7 [‚àí1.1, +0.4] W m‚àí2 (only cloud albedo effect; Forster et al., 2007) than the previous estimate in CAM-Oslo of ‚àí1.9 W m‚àí2 by Hoose et al. (2009). Due to the increased natural organic matter levels in the model, this has been ob- tained without imposing unrealistic artiÔ¨Åcial lower bounds on cloud droplet number concentrations, which are still used to constrain the radiative forcing by aerosols in many cli- mate models (see, e.g. Hoose et al., 2009). The change in di- rect radiative forcing in CAM4-Oslo from year 1850 to 2000 amounts to ‚àí0.08 W m‚àí2 (KirkevÀöag et al., 2013).\\n\\ncarbon, organic matter, sea salt, and mineral dust. Trans- ported aerosol precursor gases are dimethyl sulÔ¨Åde and SO2, while oxidant concentrations for the sulphate chemistry are prescribed. Calculation of particle numbers and sizes are based on assumed size distributions for emitted or produced primary particles, followed by subsequent growth either by condensation, coagulation, or wet phase chemistry.\\n\\nTo limit the computational cost during the integration of the model, physical properties of the aerosols, including the optical properties, are estimated by interpolating between pre-calculated values in look-up tables, using process-tagged aerosol mass concentrations and ambient relative humidity as input. The look-up tables provide spectrally resolved opti- cal parameters which are used to estimate the direct effect of aerosols in the model, as well as aerosol modal size param- eters which are used as input in the calculation of activation of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN-activation) and aerosol indirect effects.\\n\\nThe CAM4-Oslo cloud scheme includes a prognostic treatment of cloud droplet number concentration in order to represent the cloud albedo and cloud lifetime effects in liq- uid clouds. We use the parameterization scheme of Abdul- Razzak and Ghan (2000) for activation of aerosols into cloud droplets, taking into account the sizes (Hoose et al., 2009) and hygroscopicities of the aerosols (Storelvmo et al., 2006), as well as the competition for available vapour between the different particles. Internal mixing between aerosols of dif- ferent hygroscopicities is treated by assumptions on coat- ing (Hoose et al., 2009). With the horizontal grid resolu- tion of a climate model such as NorESM, updraft veloc- ities forming clouds are not resolved, and therefore need to be parameterized. As explained in Hoose et al. (2009), the current formulation of the subgrid-scale updraft veloc- ity depends on the turbulent eddy exchange coefÔ¨Åcient and a Ô¨Åxed turbulent mixing length, following Morrison and Get- telman (2008). Aerosol indirect effects on mixed-phase and ice clouds (e.g. Hoose et al., 2010) are not included in the current version of CAM4-Oslo.\\n\\nFurther aspects of the treatment of aerosols, aerosol‚Äì radiation and aerosol‚Äìcloud interactions in CAM4-Oslo, in particular the updates compared to earlier versions of the model, are thoroughly described and discussed by KirkevÀöag et al. (2013).\\n\\n2.2 Land component\\n\\nCAM4-Oslo calculates mass concentrations of aerosol species that are tagged according to production mecha- nisms in clear and cloudy air in four size classes: nucle- ation, Aitken, accumulation, and coarse mode particles. In addition to transport and removal of aerosols, microphys- ical processes that are treated are gaseous and aqueous chemistry, nucleation, condensation (by sulphuric acid gas or by water vapour, i.e. hygroscopic swelling), and coag- ulation. Included aerosol components are sulphate, black\\n\\nThe land model in NorESM is the original version 4 of the Community Land Model (CLM4) (Oleson et al., 2010; Lawrence et al., 2011) of CCSM4. Incorporated in CLM4 is the SNow, ICe, and Aerosol Radiative model (SNICAR; Flanner and Zender, 2006), which enable calculations of ra- diative effects of snow darkening caused by deposited ab- sorbing aerosols. The surface albedo and the vertical absorp- tion proÔ¨Åle depend on solar zenith angle, albedo of the under- lying snow, mass concentrations of atmospheric-deposited\\n\\nwww.geosci-model-dev.net/6/687/2013/\\n\\nGeosci.

Atmospheric-deposited aerosol components that may be treated in SNICAR are black carbon, mineral dust, and organic carbon. As in the standard setup of CLM4 in CCSM4, absorption by organic carbon is not taken into account in NorESM. In the NorESM experi- ments discussed in this study, the carbon‚Äìnitrogen (CN) cy- cle option of CLM4 is enabled (Thornton et al., 2007; Gent et al., 2011). Within the land component the carbon and ni- trogen are prognostic variables, while carbon and nitrogen Ô¨Çuxes are diagnostically determined and do not inÔ¨Çuence other model components.\\n\\nFor the NorESM experiments presented here, a grid with 1.125‚ó¶ resolution along the equator is used with the North- ern Hemisphere grid singularity located over Greenland. The grid is one of the standard grids (gx1v6) provided by CCSM4, and we adopt their ocean mask. The bathymetry is created by averaging the depths of a high resolution data set (S2004; Marks and Smith, 2006) belonging to each ocean grid cell, and editing of the bathymetry is limited to set- ting key sills and channels to their actual depths. A total of 53 model layers are used with layer reference potential den- sities in the range 28.202‚Äì37.800 kg m‚àí3.\\n\\nThe land component shares the same horizontal grid as the atmospheric component, except for the river transport model that is embedded in the land component but conÔ¨Ågured on its own grid with a horizontal resolution of 0.5‚ó¶.\\n\\n2.3 Sea ice component\\n\\nThe sea ice model in NorESM is the original CICE4 version used in CCSM4 (Gent et al., 2011; Holland et al., 2012). The code is based on version 4 of the Los Alamos Na- tional Laboratory sea ice model (CICE4) as described by Hunke and Lipscomb (2008). Important extensions of this model that are utilised in NorESM and CCSM4 are the delta- Eddington short-wave radiation transfer (Briegleb and Light, 2007), melt pond and aerosol parameterizations, all detailed by Holland et al. (2012). In NorESM, deposited aerosols on snow and ice (hydrophobic and hydrophilic black carbon, and dust) are calculated prognostically in the atmospheric component CAM4-Oslo. The sea ice component is conÔ¨Åg- ured on the same grid as the ocean component detailed be- low.\\n\\nThe incremental remapping algorithm (Dukowicz and Baumgardner, 2000) is used for the advection of layer thick- ness and tracers (including potential temperature and salin- ity). The second order accurate algorithm is expressed in Ô¨Çux form and thus by construction conserves mass and tracers. Furthermore, it guarantees monotonicity of layer thickness for a divergence free velocity Ô¨Åeld and monotonicity of trac- ers for any velocity Ô¨Åeld. For a single tracer this method is not particularly computationally efÔ¨Åcient compared to other methods of comparable accuracy, but adding additional trac- ers comes at a modest computational cost. The ability to han- dle numerous biogeochemical tracers in an accurate, robust and efÔ¨Åcient manner was an important motivation for select- ing the incremental remapping algorithm.\\n\\nThe pressure gradient force (PGF) is estimated by eval- uating the gradient of the geopotential on pressure surfaces and the geopotential is obtained by accurate vertical integra- tion of in situ density. This PGF estimation mitigates a long- standing issue in isopycnal models with inaccurate dynamics in regions where the pressure differs substantially from the reference pressure (Sun et al., 1999) and shares similarities with the Ô¨Ånite volume discretization of the PGF proposed by Adcroft et al. (2008).\\n\\n2.4 Ocean component\\n\\nThe ocean component of NorESM uses potential density as the vertical coordinate. The main motivation is to exploit the fact that isopycnic surfaces are a good approximation to neu- tral surfaces in regions of the ocean. Thus, there is a potential to formulate a numerical model with accurate transport and mixing along isopycnals and complete control of the diapyc- nal mixing applied. To maximize the neutrality of the isopy- cnal surfaces, the potential density is referenced to 2000 dbar (McDougall and Jackett, 2005). As mentioned in Sect. 1, the model is based on MICOM (Bleck and Smith, 1990; Bleck et al., 1992) and key aspects retained from MICOM are a mass conserving formulation (non-Boussinesq), Arakawa C-grid discretization, leap-frog and forward-backward time stepping for the baroclinic and barotropic mode, respec- tively, and a potential vorticity/enstrophy conserving scheme (Sadourny, 1975) for the momentum equation.\\n\\nThe new PGF formulation required modiÔ¨Åcations to the original MICOM barotropic/baroclinic mode splitting and in this process the mass and tracer conservation of the model was greatly improved. The application of time Ô¨Åltering in MICOM, needed for controlling the computational mode of the leap-frog time stepping, has been modiÔ¨Åed to sample variables at different time levels more consistently in terms of operators applied. This reduced the non-conservation of the time Ô¨Åltering. Following Morel et al. (2008), the application of column averaged variables from the baroclinic equations in the barotropic equations was modiÔ¨Åed, leading to a dou- bling of the allowable baroclinic time step.\\n\\nTo be able to handle vigorous diapycnal mixing in regions of the ocean, an implicit time integration of the diapycnal dif- fusion based on Hallberg (2000) has been implemented. This is particularly important in the modelling of gravity currents with strong vertical mixing in combination with sharp verti- cal density gradients. The potential density of interior layers might deviate from their prescribed reference potential den- sity and this is mainly due to cabbeling, absorption of pene- trating short-wave radiation, and the mixed layer detrainment\\n\\nGeosci. Model Dev., 6, 687‚Äì720, 2013\\n\\nwww.geosci-model-dev.net/6/687/2013/\\n\\nM. Bentsen et al.: The Norwegian Earth System Model, NorESM1-M\\n\\n691\\n\\nprocess. The Ô¨Çuxes obtained from solving the diapycnal dif- fusion equation are adjusted in order to reduce the deviation from prescribed potential densities.\\n\\nMICOM has a single bulk surface mixed layer while in NorESM the mixed layer is divided into two model layers with freely evolving density and equal thicknesses when the mixed layer is shallower than 20 m. The uppermost layer is limited to 10 m when the mixed layer is deeper than 20 m. The main reason for this was to allow for a faster ocean sur- face response to surface Ô¨Çuxes. The Ô¨Årst model layer below the mixed layer is not required to stay close to its prescribed reference potential density. Then there are fewer constraints on particularly the mixed layer detrainment process that now follows closely the approach of Oberhuber (1993). Further, the static stability of the uppermost layers are measured by in situ density jumps across layer interfaces, thus allowing for layers that are unstable with respect to potential density to exist. This improved the representation of water masses in weakly stratiÔ¨Åed high latitude haloclines.\\n\\nThe parameterization of thickness eddy diffusivity follows the diagnostic version of the eddy closure of Eden and Great- batch (2008) as implemented by Eden et al. (2009). The isopycnal eddy diffusivity is set equal to the thickness diffu- sivity. The lateral eddy diffusivity in the mixed layer uses the mean thickness diffusivity of the upper 100 m of the isopy- cnic interior of the model. The thickness/isopycnal/lateral eddy diffusion is reduced when the grid resolves the Ô¨Årst baroclinic Rossby radius (R. W. Hallberg, personal commu- nication, 2009). It should be noted that thickness diffusion is implemented as layer interface diffusion and will always act to reduce the available potential energy of the ocean.\\n\\nThe mixed layer depth is parameterized by considering a turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) balance equation. MICOM provides two options of TKE models based on Kraus and Turner (1967) and Gaspar (1988). We found that both formu- lations overestimated the mixed layer depth at high latitudes. A TKE model based on Oberhuber (1993), extended with a parameterization of mixed layer restratiÔ¨Åcation by eddies (Fox-Kemper et al., 2008), is now used, leading to reduced mixed layer depth biases compared to the original MICOM alternatives. An exponential decay curve is used for penetrat- ing short-wave radiation, assuming clear water everywhere (Jerlov water type 1). To reduce sea surface salinity (SSS) and stratiÔ¨Åcation biases at high latitudes, salt released during freezing of sea ice is distributed evenly below the mixed layer down to the depth with a density contrast of 0.4 kg m‚àí3 com- pared to the surface. The distribution depth of salt is limited by 500 m.\\n\\nThe background diapycnal diffusivity is vertically con- stant but with a latitude dependence approximately follow- ing Gregg et al. (2003). This gives gradually reduced dif- fusivities towards the equator with a value of 10‚àí5 m2 s‚àí1 at 30‚ó¶ latitude. Shear driven diapycnal mixing is parameter- ized using the local gradient Richardson number according to Large et al. (1994) but with increased maximum allowable\\n\\nmixing near the ocean bottom to provide sufÔ¨Åcient mixing downstream of overÔ¨Çows. Further, a portion of the energy extracted from the mean Ô¨Çow by the bottom drag is used to drive diapycnal mixing (Legg et al., 2006). Tidally driven diapycnal mixing is parameterized according to Simmons et al. (2004) using the estimated tidal energy dissipation by Jayne (2009).\\n\\nThere is no mass exchange with the other components of NorESM. Thus, the freshwater Ô¨Çuxes are converted to a vir- tual salt Ô¨Çux before they are applied in the ocean. In the ex- periments of this study, geothermal heating is not used.\\n\\n2.5 Coupler\\n\\nThe CCSM4 coupler CPL7 (Craig et al., 2012) handles the overarching execution control of the coupled system and the exchange of information between model components. Inher- ent in the coupler is a top-level driver that organises the cou- pled model into a single executable and issues calls to initial- isation, run, and Ô¨Ånalization routines for each model compo- nent. The components can be conÔ¨Ågured to run sequentially, concurrently, or as a combination of those two. This allows for Ô¨Çexible execution strategies to optimize the use of avail- able hardware resources.\\n\\nIn the experiments discussed here, the state Ô¨Åelds and Ô¨Çuxes are exchanged between the components half-hourly except for the ocean components that are coupled once per day. The land and ice components are responsible for com- puting the atmosphere/land and atmosphere/ice Ô¨Çuxes, re- spectively, while the coupler computes the atmosphere/ocean Ô¨Çuxes every half hour, providing the instantaneous Ô¨Çuxes to the atmosphere and daily mean Ô¨Çuxes to the ocean compo- nent.\\n\\n3 Experimental design\\n\\nAspects of the model tuning process prior to conducting the model experiments are described in this section. Further, the model experiments made available to CMIP5, including the pre-industrial spin-up, are described.\\n\\n3.1 Model tuning\\n\\nIn earth system models, such as NorESM, there are numer- ous parameters associated with physical parameterizations that can be assigned values within bounds set by empirical or physical reasoning. It is beyond the scope of this study to de- scribe all aspects of parameter tuning in NorESM. Emphasis here will be on the approach to minimize the radiative imbal- ance at the top of atmosphere (TOA), due to its importance for a stable climate state in CMIP5 long-term experiments.\\n\\nIn order to obtain a realistic simulated climate while main- taining a net radiative balance at the TOA, some of the cloud micro- and macrophysical parameters have been ad- justed in CAM4-Oslo compared to the values used in CAM4.\\n\\nwww.geosci-model-dev.net/6/687/2013/\\n\\nGeosci.

Bentsen et al.: The Norwegian Earth System Model, NorESM1-M\\n\\nConcerning cloud microphysics, the critical mean droplet volume radius for the onset of autoconversion, denoted r3lc in Rasch and Kristj¬¥ansson (1998) has been increased from 10 to 14 ¬µm. For comparison, Collins et al. (2006) and Seland et al. (2008) adopted the value 15 ¬µm. Finally, as in Kristj¬¥ansson (2002), the maximum precipitation rate at which the autoconversion of cloud water to rain is suppressed (Rasch and Kristj¬¥ansson, 1998), has been increased from 0.5 to 5.0 mm d‚àí1. This is the same value as used in CAM-Oslo (KirkevÀöag et al., 2008b; Seland et al., 2008; Hoose et al., 2009; Struthers et al., 2011).\\n\\nThe introduction of prognostic cloud droplet number con- centrations (CDNC) in CAM4-Oslo (following Storelvmo et al., 2006; Hoose et al., 2009) has resulted in less numerous, larger cloud droplets than in CAM4/CCSM4. Since autocon- version of cloud water to rain is more effective for the larger cloud droplets, the new CDNC treatment leads to signiÔ¨Å- cantly reduced, and thus improved, liquid water paths (LWP). Whilst global estimates of LWP from satellite retrievals vary by more than a factor of 2 from about 50 g m‚àí2 to more than 100 g m‚àí2, the value 131 g m‚àí2 in CCSM4 is reduced to 100 g m‚àí2 in CAM4-Oslo when other parameters are the same (KirkevÀöag et al., 2013). The above-mentioned tuning of the autoconversion parameters, however, tends to suppress the conversion of cloud water to rain, and the modelled LWP is therefore increased to about 122 g m‚àí2 in the pre-industrial control simulation, and about 125 g m‚àí2 for the period 1976 to 2005 in the historical simulations (Table 1). A recent ob- servational estimate based on NASA A-Train measurements (Jiang et al., 2012) gives a globally averaged LWP of 30‚Äì 51 g m‚àí2 as a best estimate and with upper and lower un- certainty limits at 102 g m‚àí2 and 15 g m‚àí2, respectively. Us- ing this study as a guideline, it is clear that NorESM over- estimates the liquid water content, in much the same way as CCSM4 does (Jiang et al., 2012).\\n\\nTable 1.

The threshold is 0.90 in NorESM while it is 0.91 in CCSM4, hence while the average global cloudiness was 46 % in CCSM4, it is 54 % in NorESM-1. This is an underesti- mation compared to data from ISCCP (67 %, see Table 1). In effect, what the tuning has accomplished is to increase the optical thickness of the clouds (proportional to the LWP) enough to compensate for the effect of a too low cloud frac- tion, so that we have achieved a radiation budget very close to balance at the TOA after about 700 yr of spin-up, and with- out serious climate drift in the following control simulation. Nevertheless, the biases in cloudiness and cloud liquid water (see Fig. 7) are clearly a weakness of NorESM (e.g. Jiang et al., 2012).\\n\\nand sea ice model and the land model CLM4 (see the cld- tunorig test in Table 7 of KirkevÀöag et al., 2013), the cloud fractions for low, medium and high level clouds were calcu- lated as 0.341, 0.187, and 0.318, compared to 0.347, 0.191, and 0.318 from the original CAM4 cloud tuning. Similarly, the stratiform and convective precipitation rates in the ofÔ¨Çine test simulations were estimated at 1.096 and 1.725 mm d‚àí1, compared to 1.108 and 1.721 mm d‚àí1 with the original tun- ing of cloud parameters. Impacts on modelled aerosol prop- erties and direct radiative forcing, as well as on cloud droplet numbers, effective droplet radii, liquid water paths and sub- sequent indirect radiative forcing are discussed by KirkevÀöag et al. (2013).\\n\\nThe stratiform cloud parameter tuning affects simulated cloud fractions as well as precipitation patterns in space and time, although giving quite small changes when globally and annually averaged.

This gave a reduction in cold snow broadband albedo of the order of 0.01 (Briegleb and Light, 2007), which caused more realistic and earlier onset of Arctic summer melt.\\n\\nthe oceanic distribution of salt released during freezing of sea ice was adjusted. These changes had only minor inÔ¨Çuences on the mean and time evolution of the model state during the remainder of the spin-up. The purpose of the multi-century spin-up was to generate a model climate with limited long- term drift, with thorough ventilation of the upper ocean, and with multiple realisations of the internally generated, inter- annual to multidecadal variability modes.\\n\\n3.2 Model experiments\\n\\nOnce the above-mentioned model tuning was set, the fully coupled NorESM was spun up for 700 yr, see Fig. 1 for an illustration of the complete spin-up and model experi- ment procedure. For the spin-up integration, the atmospheric and ice component was initialised from model restart Ô¨Åles available in the public release of CCSM4. The land compo- nent was initialised from the model state at 400 yr of a pre- industrial CCSM4 experiment with the same grid resolu- tions as the NorESM experiments described here. The ocean component was initialised with zero velocities and tempera- ture and salinity Ô¨Åelds from the Polar science center Hydro- graphic Climatology (PHC) 3.0 (updated from Steele et al., 2001).\\n\\nThe obtained climate state by the end of year 699 of the spin-up was then used as the initial value for a 500 yr long control simulation representative of the pre- industrial atmosphere (hereafter piControl), using the same forcings as for the spin-up integration. An identical ini- tial condition was used for a historical simulation incor- porating observation-based variations in solar irradiance, volcanic activity, concentration of atmospheric GHG and aerosol and other particles for the time period 1850‚Äì 2012 (hereafter Historical1). Two additional members with identical forcing protocol to Historical1 were run, start- ing from year 730 and 760 of piControl (named Histor- ical2 and Historical3, respectively). For the three histor- ical experiments, the forcings are based on observation- based data for 1850‚Äì2005 for solar radiation (Lean et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2005), stratospheric sulphate aerosol concentrations from explosive volcanoes (Ammann et al., 2003), as well as anthropogenic GHG concentrations, aerosol emissions (Lamarque et al., 2010), and land-cover changes (http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5/forcing.html). They are extended from 2006 to 2012 using the Representative Con- centration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 forcing protocol (van Vuuren et al., 2011).\\n\\nThe spin-up integration used aerosol emission and con- centrations of greenhouse gases (GHG) consistent with pre- industrial conditions deÔ¨Åned for year 1850 in accordance with CMIP5 (see also http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5/ forcing.html, and references therein). The 1850 control run has constant forcings based on an incoming solar Ô¨Çux at the model top of 1360.9 W m‚àí2 and a constant CO2 mixing ratio of 284.7 ppm. Emissions of aerosols and aerosol precursors are as in Lamarque et al. (2010) except for sea salt which is calculated according to surface wind speed and sea surface temperature (SST).

The forcings in these ex- periments follow those of the three historical experiments, namely observation-based data from 1850‚Äì2005 and forcing from the RCP8.5 protocol for 2006‚Äì2012. These simulations are the so-called GHG-only experiment, with observation- based greenhouse gases as the only varying forcing Ô¨Åeld (the remaining constituents were kept Ô¨Åxed as in piCon- trol); Aerosol-only experiment, with aerosol forcing only; and Natural-only experiment, with solar and volcanic forc- ing only. These experiments are further discussed by Iversen et al. (2013).\\n\\nTwo additional sensitivity experiments were initialised from the end of year 699 of the spin-up. These were the one percent per year increase in the atmospheric concentra- tion of CO2 (Gradual 4 √ó CO2; run for a total of 140 yr), and an abrupt quadrupling of the atmospheric concentration of CO2 (Abrupt CO2; run for a total of 150 yr). In Iversen et al. (2013), these experiments are used to estimate equilib- rium climate sensitivity and transient climate response.\\n\\nFinally, four scenario integrations were initialised from the model state by the end of year 2005 of Historical1. These integrations follow the RCP protocols RCP8.5, RCP6.0, RCP4.5 and RCP2.6, representing ‚Äúbusiness-as-usual‚Äù emis- sions, two intermediate emission scenarios and a scenario with very strong reductions in the emissions, respectively (see van Vuuren et al., 2011, for an overview of the four RCPs). Of these scenarios, all but RCP4.5 were run until year 2100, whereas RCP4.5 was continued until year 2300. Se- lected aspects of the simulations based on RCP scenarios are discussed in detail by Iversen et al. (2013).\\n\\nFig. 2.

Most emphasis will be on the evolution of oceanic quantities due to the large heat reservoir and inertia compared to the other climate system components and the relatively weak direct interaction of SSS with other components. Other quantities considered in some detail are the net radiation of the TOA since it controls the energy balance of the climate system, sea ice area because it is sensitive to ocean drift and has a strong impact on short- wave heat Ô¨Çuxes within the climate system, and gross Ô¨Çuxes in the global atmospheric water cycle because of the impor- tance of the water substance for a wide range of processes in the climate system. Linear trends are estimated by linear re- gression of annual mean data. Statistical signiÔ¨Åcance is tested using the simple t test with the number of degrees of freedom adjusted to account for autocorrelation according to Eq. (31) in Bretherton et al. (1999). We consider a trend with a p value less than 0.05 to be statistically signiÔ¨Åcant.\\n\\nTime series of various global mean quantities from NorESM piControl are shown in Fig. 2. The global mean net radiation at the TOA averaged over the whole con- trol integration is 0.086 W m‚àí2 with a small linear trend of ‚àí0.019 W m‚àí2 over 500 yr that is not statistically signiÔ¨Å- cant. This radiation imbalance at the TOA causes a steady heating of the earth system. The time-mean of the global mean net heat Ô¨Çux into the ocean is 0.122 W m‚àí2 with a small linear trend of ‚àí0.020 W m‚àí2 over 500 yr that is not statistically signiÔ¨Åcant, leading to a clearly manifested drift in the global mean ocean temperature time series. Dur- ing the 500 yr of integration the global mean ocean tempera- ture increases by 0.126 K. With no geothermal heating of the ocean and no surface mass exchange, the net surface heat Ô¨Çux should fully explain the evolution of the global mean ocean\\n\\nGeosci.

This is indeed the case and conÔ¨Årms good conservation properties of the ocean component. The time-mean TOA net radiation multiplied by the ratio of the earth area to the ocean area is 0.121 W m‚àí2 and thus close to the time-mean net heat Ô¨Çux into the ocean. This, in turn, indicates that the terrestrial and cryospheric heat reservoirs are in near thermodynamic balance during the duration of the control integration and that heat is well conserved in the model.\\n\\nThe time series of Drake Passage net volume transport in- dicate a slight weakening during the control integration that is most apparent in the Ô¨Årst half of the time series. In the pre-industrial spin-up a decreasing tendency of the Drake Passage transport is indeed present (not show), but the ten- dency gradually reduces during the course of the integra- tion. The linear trend in the time series of Drake Passage transport is ‚àí6.29 Sv over 500 yr and is statistically signif- icant. In the pre-industrial spin-up the strength of the At- lantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) accel- erates during the Ô¨Årst 50 yr of integration (not shown) be- fore settling around a mean state with a modest long-term drift. The time series of maximum strength at 26.5‚ó¶ N of the AMOC has a linear trend of ‚àí0.6 Sv over 500 yr that is sta- tistically signiÔ¨Åcant.\\n\\nThe linear trend of the SST time series is 0.031 K over 500 yr and thus much lower than the trend of global mean, volume-averaged ocean temperature. Further, the linear trend of global near surface air temperature is 0.037 K over 500 yr. Both the SST and near surface air temperature trends are sta- tistically signiÔ¨Åcant.\\n\\nFor the pre-industrial model spin-up there is a reduction in the global mean SSS from about 34.75 g kg‚àí1 to about 34.50 g kg‚àí1 during 700 yr of integration (not shown). This freshening tendency gradually reduces as the spin-up pro- gresses. In the time series of global mean SSS from pi- Control, a remnant freshening tendency can be seen dur- ing the Ô¨Årst 200 yr of integration (Fig. 2), with a possi- ble remaining drift likely masked by multidecadal variabil- ity thereafter. Comparing global mean SSS for the Ô¨Årst 50 and the last 300 yr of the NorESM piControl, there is a re- duction of about 0.02 g kg‚àí1, thus we consider the global mean SSS to be fairly stable throughout the control inte- gration. There is a very small, although statistically signif- icant, linear trend in the time series of global mean salinity of ‚àí3.14 √ó 10‚àí4 g kg‚àí1 over 500 yr. With no mass exchange through the ocean surface and assuming balanced freshwater\\n\\nLatitude‚Äìtime Hovm¬®oller diagrams of zonal mean SST and SSS from NorESM piControl are provided in Fig. 3a and b, respectively. The small drift of global mean SST is conÔ¨Årmed here with no particular model drift at any latitudes. The before-mentioned freshening of global mean SSS during the Ô¨Årst 200 yr of piControl is evident and manifested fairly uniformly south of 70‚ó¶ N.\\n\\nFigure 3c and d show depth‚Äìtime Hovm¬®oller diagrams of global mean ocean potential temperature and salinity, respec- tively, with observational estimates subtracted. It can be seen that the warming of global mean ocean temperature occurs mainly below 2000 m depth. The general picture of the evo- lution of salinity is a slight freshening above 2000 m depth and a compensation with gradually more saline water masses\\n\\nwww.geosci-model-dev.net/6/687/2013/\\n\\nGeosci.

The long-term mean of E‚ÄìP is 2.3 √ó 10‚àí5 mm d‚àí1, conÔ¨Årming a very well balanced fresh water budget of the atmosphere. This is consistent with the virtually negligible drift of global mean salinity discussed above, indicating that NorESM conserves the fresh water substance to a large ex- tent. Annual mean values of global mean P Ô¨Çuctuate between 2.80 and 2.81 mm d‚àí1 (i.e. 520 √ó 103 to 521 √ó 103 km3 yr‚àí1 globally) and have a linear trend of 0.0029 mm d‚àí1 over 500 yr that is not statistically signiÔ¨Åcant.\\n\\nDue to the generally small linear trends of global mean variables, we have not subtracted the trend of NorESM pi- Control from other NorESM experiments in any of the sub- sequent analyses. For analyses that are sensitive to the time evolution of the deep ocean temperature, e.g. studies of sea level change, we do recommend taking into account the long- term trend in ocean temperature.\\n\\nFig. 4. Time series of (a) northern and (b) southern hemispheric sea ice extent (106 km2) for March and September in piControl. Black lines show simulated annual mean time series and red lines show ob- served annual mean and ¬±2 sd for the years 1979‚Äì2005 (data from NSIDC, Fetterer et al., 2009).\\n\\n5 Mean model state\\n\\nIn the evaluation of the NorESM mean state, the majority of the analysis is from the Historical1 experiment and consider- ing means over years 1976‚Äì2005. During this time period the observational coverage of several components of the climate system is good and includes satellite measurements. With a 30 yr averaging period, the inÔ¨Çuence of internal model vari- ability up to decadal timescales is expected to have a modest inÔ¨Çuence on the assessment of the model mean state. An ex- ception is the analysis of the gross cycling of fresh water (Ta- ble 2) using means for the years 2000‚Äì2005 of the Historical1 experiment to be more consistent with corresponding mean values from observational synthesis and atmospheric reanal- ysis covering the years 2002‚Äì2008. Further, the mean ocean meridional overturning circulation (MOC) is from a 30 yr pe- riod of the piControl experiment.\\n\\nbelow. The last 200 yr of piControl the salinity remains al- most constant at all depths except for the very deepest water masses that occupy only a small fraction of the total ocean mass.\\n\\nTime series of Northern and Southern Hemisphere sea ice extent for March and September is shown in Fig. 4. The sum- mer minimum values are stable without signiÔ¨Åcant trends in both hemispheres, whereas the winter maximum extents decrease during the simulation. The winter trends for the Northern and Southern Hemispheres are 0.15 √ó 106 km2 and 0.81√ó106 km2 over 500 yr, respectively, and these trends are statistically signiÔ¨Åcant.\\n\\nOverall, atmospheric variables have small trends through- out the 500 yr of piControl. As mentioned above, the net ra- diation at the TOA has a small negative trend that is not sta- tistically signiÔ¨Åcant. The individual components, net short- wave (SW) and long-wave (LW) radiation at the TOA, have mean values of 232.43 W m‚àí2 and 232.33 W m‚àí2, respec- tively, with corresponding linear trends of 0.033 W m‚àí2 and 0.052 W m‚àí2 over 500 yr. Cloud characteristics are also sta- ble during the control integration, and the mean total cloud cover is 54.1 % with a linear trend of 0.012 % over 500 yr. Total cloud LWP has a mean of 122.3 g m‚àí2 and a trend of 0.043 g m‚àí2 over 500 yr. Further, the long-term means of short-wave (SWCF) and long-wave cloud forcing (LWCF) are ‚àí54.83 W m‚àí2 and 30.91 W m‚àí2, respectively, with lin- ear trends of ‚àí0.021 W m‚àí2 and 0.028 W m‚àí2 over 500 yr. None of the trends of atmospheric variables discussed here are statistically signiÔ¨Åcant.\\n\\n5.1 Heat budget considerations and surface\\n\\ntemperature\\n\\nTable 1 provides selected global mean values for the years 1976‚Äì2005 of the Historical1 simulation with NorESM along with observations or reanalysis products from recent decades. The net TOA SW Ô¨Çux of NorESM is 234.9 W m‚àí2 and the observations listed in the table are in the range 234.0‚Äì 244.7 W m‚àí2. It should be noted that the NorESM values are adjusted for the fact that the top of the model is slightly below the TOA seen from satellites (Collins et al., 2006). The actual net downward SW Ô¨Çux at the top of the model is 231.8 W m‚àí2, while the net upward LW Ô¨Çux at the top of model is 231.3 W m‚àí2. Hence, the model experiences an approximate radiative imbalance of +0.5 W m‚àí2 at its up- per boundary during the years 1976‚Äì2005. The adjusted net TOA LW Ô¨Çux of the model is 232.4 W m‚àí2, i.e. slightly be- low the observational range of 233.9‚Äì239.6 W m‚àí2.

The apparently small biases in the TOA cloud forcing are in contrast to the clear underestimation of total cloud cover as mentioned in Sect. 3.1, probably because the underestimated cloud cover is compensated by an overestimated LWP (Jiang et al., 2012). In Fig. 5 the annual mean sensible and latent heat Ô¨Çuxes from NorESM Historical1 are compared to the FLUXNET Model Tree Ensembles (MTE) estimates (Jung et al., 2011). FLUXNET-MTE estimates are restricted to vegetated land surface, and this is the reason why no Ô¨Çuxes are estimated for the desert zones. The NorESM simulated annual mean sensi- ble heat Ô¨Çux (Fig. 5a) is in the same range as the FLUXNET- MTE estimations (Fig. 5b). As seen in Fig. 5c, NorESM un- derestimates sensible heat Ô¨Çux in most of the African conti- nent south of Sahara, on the west coast of India, in Australia, and in the western part of the United States. The model over- estimates sensible heat Ô¨Çux in the extreme eastern part of South America. Comparing NorESM and FLUXNET-MTE estimates, the root mean square error (RMSE) normalized by the standard deviation of the FLUXNET-MTE estimate is 1.01 and 0.65 for sensible and latent heat Ô¨Çux, respectively, and the spatial correlations are 0.52 and 0.82 for sensible and latent heat Ô¨Çux, respectively. Thus, from the distribution point of view, the simulation of annual mean latent heat Ô¨Çux (Fig. 5d) compares better with the FLUXNET-MTE estimate (Fig. 5e). Figure 5f show that NorESM generally overesti- mates latent heat Ô¨Çuxes compared to FLUXNET-MTE, but with clear underestimations in the extreme eastern part of South America. As listed in Table 1, the global mean sur- face sensible heat Ô¨Çux for the years 1976‚Äì2005 of Histor- ical1 is 17.8 W m‚àí2 and within the observational range of 13.2‚Äì19.4 W m‚àí2, while the global mean surface latent heat Ô¨Çux of 81.7 W m‚àí2 is slightly below the observational range of 82.4‚Äì89.1 W m‚àí2, which is in contrast to the general over- estimation compared to FLUXNET-MTE.\\n\\nthe NorESM Historical1 experiment and the observational data set TS3.1 from the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) for the years 1976‚Äì2005. The model generally underestimates the temperature over the continents with a mean difference of ‚àí1.09 K. For the same experiment and time period, the SST bias is only ‚àí0.15 K (see Sect. 5.5 below). There are notable exceptions over South America and in western parts of Eurasia (including Europe) where there are overestimates. Thus, NorESM produces a slightly too cold surface climate and is colder compared to the last few decades of 20th cen- tury experiments with CCSM4 (Gent et al., 2011). One pos- sible candidate that may account for a considerable part of this difference is the inclusion of the aerosol indirect effect in NorESM. Furthermore, there is a possibility that the model slightly overestimates the cooling by the aerosol direct ef- fect since there appears to be a small but ubiquitous overesti- mate of aerosol loads in the upper free troposphere (KirkevÀöag et al., 2013). As discussed by Iversen et al. (2013), clouds contribute to a small negative gross feedback which thus dampen the simulated 20th century temperature increase. Also, the model overestimates the Arctic cloudiness and the summer-season snowmelt is probably too slow. Combined with slightly too weak winds across the polar basin, this leads to too thick sea ice in the polar oceans adjacent to the Eurasian continent. The summer sea ice extent in the Arctic is too large (Fig. 4), and this contributes to underestimated global temperatures. Note that the global pattern of this un- derestimate (see Fig. 6) reÔ¨Çects dynamical factors such as changed occurrence of modes of variability or Ô¨Çow regimes (Palmer, 1999; Branstator and Selten, 2009) and geograph- ically determined feedbacks in the climate system associ- ated with strong interactions between the atmosphere and the ground surface (e.g. sea ice and snow cover), as discussed by Boer and Yu (2003). Hence, given that there is a slightly too cold climate, it is natural that the amplitude is larger over continents than the ocean (e.g. the cold-ocean/warm- land pattern, Wallace et al., 1996) and at high latitudes.\\n\\nFigure 6 shows the difference in air temperature over land at reference height (2 m) above the ground surface between\\n\\nwww.geosci-model-dev.net/6/687/2013/\\n\\nGeosci.

The water substance is present in all three phases in the atmosphere and is an important vehicle for cycling of energy between the atmosphere and the other com- partments of the earth system. Clouds are important for the radiation budget both for visible and terrestrial infrared radia- tion. Precipitation amounts and types, as well as the absence of precipitation, are weather parameters with profound im- pacts on nature and society. The release of latent heat when water vapour condensates in the atmosphere is a source of energy that tends to feed back positively on the dynamic pro- cesses responsible for triggering precipitation. It is therefore unfortunate that many aspects of the water cycle are difÔ¨Åcult to simulate accurately in climate models (e.g. Meehl et al., 2007), mainly due to the small spatial scales involved and the intricate interaction between micro- and macrophysics in clouds. Hydrological processes on the land surface represent another source of complexity. Finally, snow and ice on land\\n\\nFig. 6.

The recycling of oceanic fresh water (P /E)OCEAN is only slightly underestimated (0.4 %), indicating that while the in- tensity of the water cycle is slightly on the high side, the at- mospheric residence time of oceanic water vapour is quite correct. In comparison, CCSM4‚Äôs estimate of the Ô¨Çux of wa- ter vapour from ocean to land is very close to the obser- vationally based estimate by Trenberth et al. (2011). How- ever, the oceanic evaporation in CCSM4 is, also according to the estimates of Trenberth et al. (2011), exaggerated by 8 %, while the re-cycling is overestimated by almost 1 % in that model. It is believed that these differences between NorESM and CCSM4 are linked to aerosols and the tuning of cloud properties. In CCSM4, a larger fraction of solar ra- diation reaches the ground and the precipitation autoconver- sion is faster. The values from the ERA-Interim reanalysis\\n\\nFollowing Trenberth et al. (2011), E and P integrated over oceans are key quantities to diagnose gross properties of the earth‚Äôs water cycle, given that the global totals of the same quantities are equal. The fraction (P /E)OCEAN deÔ¨Ånes the recycling of fresh water over the oceans, and is a (simple) measure of the atmospheric residence time of a bulk part of the water vapour provided to the atmosphere. The remaining difference (E‚ÄìP )OCEAN is the net transport of water vapour from oceans to the earth‚Äôs continents. The global average precipitation in NorESM is slightly more than 2.80 mm d‚àí1 (or about 521 √ó 103 km3 yr‚àí1), which is 0.13‚Äì0.14 mm d‚àí1 or 4.9 % too large if compared to the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) data (Adler et al., 2003), but this value was claimed to be an underestimate by Trenberth et al. (2007). Taking the observational synthesis of Tren- berth et al. (2007, 2011) to be the best estimate of the true\\n\\nwww.geosci-model-dev.net/6/687/2013/\\n\\nGeosci.

As found in Table 1, the global mean value for the years 1976‚Äì2005 of Historical1 gives a bias of ‚àí23.88 % with a RMSE of 25.74 % when compared to the CLOUD- SAT data, and a bias of ‚àí13.04 % with a RMSE of 17.39 % compared to ISCCP. Exceptions include very high latitudes where there are too much clouds, and this is most pronounced for the winter and summer months in both hemispheres (not shown). At the same time, the liquid water in clouds is gen- erally exaggerated, although Fig. 7 is only valid over oceans due to the nature of the SSMI retrievals. The exaggeration is particularly pronounced in the extratropical storm track re- gions, a result further corroborated by Jiang et al. (2012). We have no good explanation for these bias errors concerning the clouds, which were already present in the original model version CCSM4 (Gent et al., 2011). Still it is a fair conclu- sion that NorESM is slightly improved compared to CCSM4. There are more clouds in NorESM and the overestimated LWP is about 5 % lower than for CCSM4. The prognostic cloud droplet scheme is directly linked to CCN-activation from the online aerosols, and permits tuning of the precip- itation autoconversion to yield improved gross properties of the cycling of fresh water in the model (Table 2).\\n\\nTo assess the quality of the simulated precipitation clima- tology, we compare it with the GPCP, the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission 3B43 product (TRMM, Huffman et al., 2007) and the merged Legates precipitation data (Legates and Willmott, 1990; Spencer, 1993).\\n\\nand can be compared to the discussion by Gent et al. (2011) around their Fig. 5. Compared to the 2‚ó¶ version of CCSM4, the NorESM does not have a signiÔ¨Åcant negative bias along the equator in the PaciÔ¨Åc. In that respect its climatology is more similar to the 1‚ó¶ version of the CCSM4, although the spatial resolution is 2‚ó¶ in NorESM. Another distinct feature of the NorESM is that the ITCZ-related bias is more con- Ô¨Åned to the Northern Hemisphere, while the bias in CCSM4 is more symmetric about the equator.\\n\\nOne possible contributor to reducing the bias in NorESM compared to CCSM4 is the aerosol direct and indirect ef- fect in NorESM. Earlier work suggests that aerosol forcing may cause a southward displacement of the ITCZ (Rotstayn and Lohmann, 2002; Kristjansson et al., 2005). This effect is further discussed by Iversen et al. (2013), but as discussed already by KirkevÀöag et al. (2008a), this impact on ITCZ by aerosols may cause co-inÔ¨Çuence on tropical precipitation by the GHG and aerosols separately, which tends to reduce (but not remove) the double ITCZ feature.\\n\\nSome other notable tropical biases are shared with CCSM4. There is a characteristic dipole bias in the Indian Ocean and excess precipitation over the African continent and along the western coast of South America (Fig. 7b). The latter bias is connected to too high orographic precipitation rates in the Andes (Cook et al., 2012). There is also a sig- niÔ¨Åcant negative precipitation bias in the Atlantic Ocean at around 10‚ó¶ N‚Äì20‚ó¶ N which is co-located with the cold SST bias shown in Fig. 12b. The midlatitude precipitation biases in the North Atlantic can also be seen to be closely associated with biases in the simulated SSTs.\\n\\n5.3 Zonal mean atmosphere\\n\\nFigure 7e and f show the zonal mean precipitation dur- ing the boreal winter (DJF) and summer season (JJA), re- spectively. The model captures the main latitudinal distribu- tion with a precipitation peak near the equator, secondary peaks associated with the winter midlatitude storm tracks and minima for the drier subtropics. However, the magnitude of tropical precipitation is clearly overestimated compared to GPCP. Although the comparison with the Legates data set gives somewhat conÔ¨Çicting results, the excessive tropi- cal precipitation in NorESM is also evident when compared to TRMM (Fig. 8a and b).\\n\\nFigure 8 shows that a main feature of the tropical bias is related to the double Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) problem that has long been a common error among climate models (Lin, 2007). The simulated precipitation is clearly characterized by a double ITCZ structure over the central Pa- ciÔ¨Åc and equatorial Atlantic which is not found in the TRMM observations (Fig. 8a and b). This bias is also associated with too much precipitation variability at the same locations (Fig. 8c and d).\\n\\nIn order to compare the simulated precipitation with that of CCSM4, the bias relative to GPCP is shown in Fig. 7b (global bias of 0.198 mm d‚àí1 with a RMSE of 1.23 mm d‚àí1)\\n\\nFigure 9 shows the zonally averaged mean atmospheric tem- perature for the Historical1 simulation of the NorESM and its bias relative to the ERA40 reanalysis (Uppala et al., 2005). The air temperature in the troposphere is in general too cold for both boreal summer and winter. This general feature is also conÔ¨Årmed with other reanalysis and satellite data (not shown). In the lower polar troposphere during DJF, there is a notable positive bias over the Arctic and a negative one over the Antarctic. Although this may be related to the over- estimation of the polar cloud cover, it should be emphasized that the reanalyses themselves have signiÔ¨Åcant biases over the data sparse polar regions (e.g. Bromwich et al., 2007). Near the polar tropopause there is a relatively large cold bias of magnitude 7‚Äì8 K (up to 10 K over Antarctica during DJF). A cold bias in this region is also prominent in the CMIP5 en- semble mean (Charlton-Perez et al., 2013).\\n\\nThe simulation of the zonal mean zonal wind and bias with respect to the NCEP reanalysis (Kalnay et al., 1996) are shown in Fig. 10. Both the strength and seasonal mi- gration of the Northern Hemisphere tropospheric jets can be seen to be well captured by the model, although the subtrop- ical and eddy-driven jets are slightly more separated during\\n\\nGeosci.

In the Southern Hemisphere the subtropical jet is too strong during DJF with an eastward bias of 4‚Äì6 m s‚àí1. There is also a notable eastward bias over the equator in the upper troposphere.

The underestimation in March in the Northern Hemisphere is mostly due to too little ice in the Labrador Sea, consistent with the warm SST bias found in that area (Fig. 12b). The ice extent during summer is larger than observed in the Northern Hemisphere. The modelled ge- ographic distributions of ice are close to observations, but the main overestimations are in BafÔ¨Ån Bay and the Kara Sea.\\n\\n5.4 Sea ice mean state\\n\\nThe thickest ice found in the simulations is north of Greenland and Ellesmere Island, in agreement with obser- vational climatologies (Rothrock et al., 2008). Also, in the central Arctic, the thickness is comparable with estimates based on submarines from the late 1970s (Rothrock et al., 2008; Kwok and Rothrock, 2009). At the North Pole mod- elled March values are close to 4.5 m, while estimates from Rothrock et al. (2008) for this month are very similar for the years 1975‚Äì1979 (4.4‚Äì4.7 m).

Satellite estimates from 2006‚Äì2007 (Kwok and Cunningham, 2008) give values near the North Pole of 2‚Äì2.5 m, while thickness near the East Siberian coast is 1‚Äì2 m. Clearly, the modelled ice is too thick compared with these estimates. However, as discussed by Kwok and Rothrock (2009), there was a considerable loss of Arctic ice volume after year 2000. The modelled central Arctic sea ice thickness therefore seems to be more similar to that observed during the 1970s than after 2005.\\n\\net al. (2008) indicate mean thickness of 0.89 m and 1.33 m in eastern (sector 45‚ó¶ W‚Äì20‚ó¶ E) and western (sector 60‚ó¶ W‚Äì 45‚ó¶ W) Weddell Sea, respectively, while modelled mean val- ues are 0.5‚Äì1.5 m in the eastern, and from 1.5 m to more than 4 m in the western Weddell Sea, respectively.

A Deacon cell with a strength of about 25 Sv is present at 60‚ó¶ S‚Äì40‚ó¶ S. This cell is not present when the MOC is presented as a function of potential density (not shown), consistent with the Ô¨Åndings of D¬®o¬®os and Webb (1994). There is an abyssal counterclockwise circulation with maximum strength at 50‚ó¶ S‚Äì30‚ó¶ S in excess of 10 Sv. The prominent clockwise circulation with maximum strength at 30‚ó¶ N‚Äì40‚ó¶ N is due to the AMOC that is shown separately in Fig. 13b. The time series of the maximum annual mean AMOC strength at 26.5‚ó¶ N in the NorESM piControl exper- iment is shown in Fig. 2 and has a time-mean of 30.8 Sv. This is in the upper range of AMOC strengths found in mod- els contributing to phase 3 of the Climate Model Intercom- parison Project (CMIP3) (Medhaug and Furevik, 2011) and well above an estimate of 17.4 Sv of the AMOC strength at 26.5‚ó¶ N using observations for the years 2004‚Äì2011 (Srokosz et al., 2012). It is not clear what causes the vigorous AMOC intensity in this NorESM experiment. The counterclockwise abyssal circulation of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) in the Atlantic basin is not very prominent in the simulation. The MOC of the NorESM Historical1 experiment is very similar to that of the pre-industrial control.\\n\\nFig. 11.

In the global zonal mean potential temperature difference (Fig. 14a), the largest positive biases are found in the upper ocean (< 500 m depth) in latitude bands 60‚ó¶ S‚Äì20‚ó¶ S and 10‚ó¶ N‚Äì60‚ó¶ N and around 60‚ó¶ N covering the whole depth. Below 1000 m there are large regions with temperature biases larger than 0.3 K. Cold biases in the global zonal mean are prominent in the depth range 200‚Äì1000 m south of 50‚ó¶ N. North of 60‚ó¶ N there is a negative bias above 500 m depth and below 2000 m with a warm bias in between. Compared to the global zonal mean, the Atlantic zonal mean potential temperature biases (Fig. 14b) are much larger and likely explain some of the differences seen in the former. Except from a prominent cold bias in the depth range 200‚Äì1000 m and latitude range 40‚ó¶ S‚Äì 50‚ó¶ N, there is an overall large warm bias north of 40‚ó¶ S in the Atlantic domain, reaching above 2 K in considerable re- gions. In the Southern Ocean south of 40‚ó¶ S there is a warm bias below 1500 m and a cold bias above. The overall pic- ture of a fresh and saline bias of the upper and deep ocean, respectively, seen in Fig. 3d is conÔ¨Årmed in the global zonal mean salinity difference from observations seen in Fig. 14c. Fresh biases are found in a large portion of the ocean above 1500‚Äì2000 m and south of 60‚ó¶ N, with the largest negative bias (< ‚àí0.5 g kg‚àí1) in the upper 500 m in the latitude band 40‚ó¶ S‚Äì20‚ó¶ N. Saline biases are found below 1500‚Äì2000 m and south of 60‚ó¶ N, while north of 60‚ó¶ N there is a positive bias in most of the ocean column in excess of 0.25 g kg‚àí1. The pattern of Atlantic zonal mean salinity difference from\\n\\nof the Southern Ocean, and in the subpolar North Atlantic. Negative SST biases are mainly found at around 20‚ó¶ S and 20‚ó¶ N in the Atlantic Ocean and in a zonal band around 20‚Äì 30‚ó¶ N in the PaciÔ¨Åc Ocean. Except for the bias in the subpolar North Atlantic, the pattern of differences has many similar- ities with recent CCSM4 experiments (Gent et al., 2011). They Ô¨Ånd that particularly the bias in the upwelling regions is reduced with increasing atmospheric resolution since the higher resolution atmosphere allows for more realistic wind patterns near the coast, favouring stronger upwelling, thereby reducing SST directly and indirectly through cloud feedback (Gent et al., 2010).\\n\\nThe global mean SSS difference is ‚àí0.15 g kg‚àí1 with a RMSE of 0.83 g kg‚àí1. Negative SSS biases cover most of the low latitudes with small biases in the Southern Ocean and mostly positive biases north of 40‚ó¶ N. Large positive biases of more than 2 g kg‚àí1 cover most of the Arctic Ocean with even larger differences on the Siberian shelf.\\n\\nThe SSH model climatology, with a RMSE of 0.16 m com- pared to an observational estimate, indicates that the model captures the general aspects of the large-scale circulation. Positive SSH biases are found in large portions of the In- dian Ocean, and negative biases cover most of the Atlantic with large negative biases (< ‚àí0.35 m) in the north-western North Atlantic.\\n\\nwww.geosci-model-dev.net/6/687/2013/\\n\\nGeosci.

Thus, it is likely that NorESM‚Äôs representation of the Mediterranean outÔ¨Çow contributes to the large warm and saline biases in the deep Atlantic and clearly manifested at about 30‚ó¶ N and 3000 m depth.\\n\\nIn Fig. 15a the meridional heat transport of NorESM Histori- cal1 for the years 1976‚Äì2005 is compared to estimates by Fa- sullo and Trenberth (2008) (FT08 hereafter). In FT08 there is almost no meridional heat transport across the equator, while in NorESM there is a northward heat transport of 0.6 PW carried by the ocean. In both hemispheres, NorESM slightly underestimates the total transport compared to FT08, with largest differences in the Southern Hemisphere. In Fig. 15b the ocean heat transport is split up in contributions from the Atlantic Ocean and PaciÔ¨Åc and Indian Ocean combined. Compared to FT08, NorESM carries more heat northward over the whole extent of the Atlantic Ocean with most pro- nounced differences between 20‚ó¶ N and 60‚ó¶ N that might be attributed to the strong simulated AMOC. The strong ocean heat transport in this latitude band seems to be compensated by a weaker atmospheric transport compared to FT08. The ocean southward transport between 65‚ó¶ S and 30‚ó¶ S is also stronger than indicated by FT08. Further, the ocean heat transport deviation from FT08 from the equator to 15‚ó¶ S is mainly due to weaker southward transport in the PaciÔ¨Åc and Indian Ocean.\\n\\nThe cold bias in the depth range 200‚Äì1000 m seen in Fig. 14a and b indicates that the thermocline depth in NorESM is shallower than in observations. According to Munk (1966) this would, on the global scale, indicate ei- ther too strong upwelling, balanced by excessive deep wa- ter formation, or too weak diapycnal mixing. Both Megann et al. (2010) and Dunne et al. (2012) compare climate model experiments that only differ in the choice of ocean compo- nents, which is either a z coordinate model or a model with interior isopycnic layers, the latter of similar type of that used in NorESM. Both comparisons indicate a shallower than ob- served thermocline depth with isopycnal models and deeper than observed depth with z coordinate models. This is at- tributed to less diapycnal mixing in the isopycnic models compared to the z coordinate models. Although NorESM share this thermocline depth bias with other climate mod- els featuring isopycnic ocean components, it is not clear that unrealistic weak diapycnal mixing is causing the shallow thermocline depth in NorESM since in particular the strong AMOC might contribute to excessive deep water formation.\\n\\nwww.geosci-model-dev.net/6/687/2013/\\n\\nGeosci.

Data sources are HadISST (black), Historical1 (blue), and piControl (red).\\n\\n6.1 Tropical variability\\n\\nThe El NiÀúno‚ÄìSouthern Oscillation (ENSO) is a coupled ocean‚Äìatmosphere phenomenon that has a major impact on the climate variability of the tropical PaciÔ¨Åc on seasonal to interannual timescales (Wallace et al., 1998), but also with a strong inÔ¨Çuence on the global scale (Trenberth et al., 1998). The monitoring of ENSO is commonly summarised by in- dices involving tropical PaciÔ¨Åc SST anomalies or sea level pressure (SLP) differences. To investigate the representation of ENSO in NorESM, the detrended monthly SST anoma- lies of the NINO3.4 region (5‚ó¶ S‚Äì5‚ó¶ N; 170‚ó¶ W‚Äì120‚ó¶ W) are used. The NINO3.4 index is obtained by normalizing these SST anomalies by their long-term standard deviation. Fig- ure 16 shows time series of detrended monthly SST anoma- lies of the NINO3.4 region for the HadISST data set and NorESM Historical1 for the years 1900‚Äì2005. Also shown\\n\\nare SST anomalies from the corresponding years of the NorESM piControl. The standard deviation of NorESM His- torical1 and piControl are 0.92 K and 0.86 K, respectively, and both are larger than the standard deviation of HadISST of 0.75 K.\\n\\nFigure 17 shows the power spectra of the normalized time series of Fig. 16. The observation-based NINO3.4 index has most power on periods 3‚Äì7 yr while both NorESM indices have the most prominent variability on timescales 2‚Äì4 yr. On timescales longer than 10 yr, the NorESM piControl has less power compared to both HadISST and NorESM Histor- ical1.

It is characterized by large-scale regions of enhanced and sup- pressed convection coupled to circulation anomalies that to- gether propagate slowly eastward along the equator. The MJO interacts with several large-scale climate phenomena including El NiÀúno events (Hendon et al., 2007), the on- set and break of the Indian summer monsoon (Annemalai and Slingo, 2001), formation of tropical cyclones (Liebmann et al., 1994) and its inÔ¨Çuence also extends to the NAO and extratropical variability (Cassou, 2008). A realistic simula- tion of the MJO is therefore important to improve climate prediction of such phenomena.\\n\\nGeneral circulation models (GCMs) have long struggled to realistically simulate the basic features of the MJO. Lin et al. (2006) found that only 2 out of 14 GCMs participating in the IPCC AR4 had MJO variance comparable to observa- tions. However, Subramanian et al. (2011) have shown that the representation of the MJO in the CCSM4 model, with a new convective parameterization scheme (in CAM4), is signiÔ¨Åcantly improved. To evaluate the MJO in the NorESM and to facilitate comparison with other GCMs, we use the diagnostic tools proposed by Waliser et al. (2009). The com- plete set of recommended diagnostics is beyond the scope of this paper so only the wavenumber‚Äìfrequency spectra and coherence Ô¨Ågures for boreal winter are presented here.\\n\\nFig. 18. Correlation between local and NINO34 region SST anoma- lies for (a) HadISST and (b) Historical1. The anomalies are found by subtracting the monthly means for the whole time series that span years 1900‚Äì2005 for both data sets. Hatched area indicates regions where the correlation is not signiÔ¨Åcantly different from vanishing correlation at the 95 % conÔ¨Ådence level. In the estimation of conÔ¨Å- dence intervals, the number of degrees of freedom is adjusted due to autocorrelation according to Quenouille (1952).\\n\\nThe wavenumber‚Äìfrequency of the NCEP 850 hPa zonal wind (Fig. 19a) is characterized by maximum energy for zonal wavenumbers 1‚Äì3 over periods of 30‚Äì80 days, with a dominant peak for zonal wavenumber 1 and period of approximately 60 days. The NorESM contains signiÔ¨Åcant eastward-propagating energy in the 30‚Äì80 day band for wavenumber 1 (Fig. 19b). However, its energy is spread over more frequencies and peaks at a longer period. Simi- larly, for outgoing long-wave radiation (OLR) the energy in the NorESM is spread over more frequencies and the peak is slightly weaker compared to the observed power spectra (Fig. 19c and d).\\n\\ncontribute to this difference in decadal and longer variability, although a more careful analysis is required to establish this. The correlation of NINO3.4 SST anomalies with global SST anomalies for HadISST and NorESM (Fig. 18) reveals a too narrow meridional width of the correlation in the trop- ical PaciÔ¨Åc east of 160‚ó¶ E. The U-shaped pattern of nega- tive correlation in the PaciÔ¨Åc is seen in both HadISST and NorESM but less pronounced in the model. NorESM has positive correlations in the western part of the Indian Ocean although weaker than in HadISST. The positive correlation seen in HadISST in the north-eastern Indian Ocean, extend- ing into Gulf of Thailand and South China Sea, is missing in NorESM. The patterns of correlation in the Atlantic Ocean are quite similar in both HadISST and NorESM. In Gent et al. (2011), similar correlation maps are shown for CCSM3 with T85 atmospheric resolution and CCSM4 with 1‚ó¶ atmo- spheric resolution. Overall, CCSM4 compares favourably to observations compared to both CCSM3 and NorESM and many of the discrepancies of NorESM discussed above also hold for CCSM3. The dominant power of the NINO3.4 in- dex on 2‚Äì4 yr timescale in NorESM falls between CCSM3 and CCSM4, with dominant variability in the range 1.75‚Äì3 yr and 3‚Äì6 yr, respectively (Deser et al., 2012).\\n\\nCross-spectral calculations are performed to quantify the coherence and phase lag between equatorial OLR and 850 hPa zonal winds. Figure 20a shows that observations ex- hibit a high degree of coherence for wavenumbers 1‚Äì3 and a phase lag of approximately 90‚ó¶ in the 30‚Äì80 day band. NorESM also exhibits strong coherence for wavenumber 1 in the 30‚Äì80 day band, although it peaks at slightly higher fre- quencies compared to observations. This characteristic was also observed in CCSM4 by Subramanian et al. (2011) and may suggest more convectively coupled linear Kelvin wave activity in the model than observations. Similarly to CCSM4, the NorESM also fails to simulate the strong coherency for wavenumbers 2‚Äì3 found in observations. Despite such short- comings, these diagnostics show that NorESM is able to pro- duce coherent eastward-propagating waves in the intrasea- sonal zonal winds and OLR over the tropical Indian and Pa- ciÔ¨Åc Oceans.\\n\\nThe Madden‚ÄìJulian oscillation (MJO) is the dominant mode of intraseasonal (30‚Äì90 days) variability in the tropical\\n\\nwww.geosci-model-dev.net/6/687/2013/\\n\\nGeosci.

The simulated NAM has larger amplitudes over the Arctic and North PaciÔ¨Åc and the Atlantic centres of action are shifted to the east. This likely explains why the simulated NAM represents 36 % of the hemispheric variance compared to the observed 23 %. These main biases in the simulated NAM are very similar to those documented by Hurrell et al. (2006) for the CAM3 model. The more symmetric zonal structure of the simulated NAM and stronger teleconnection between the PaciÔ¨Åc and Atlantic are biases that have been found earlier in many models (Os- born, 2004). The SAM is deÔ¨Åned as the Ô¨Årst EOF of South- ern Hemisphere (20‚Äì90‚ó¶ S) monthly mean 850 hPa geopo- tential height data. The spatial structure of the simulated SAM is well simulated with only small differences in am- plitude (Fig. 21). The represented variances of the leading EOF of the Southern Hemisphere for NorESM and NCEP-2 are 23 % and 26 %, respectively.\\n\\n6.2 Annular modes\\n\\nThe Northern and Southern Annular Modes (NAM and SAM) are the dominant patterns of variability in the extratropical atmosphere on intraseasonal to interdecadal timescales (Thompson and Wallace, 2000). They represent north‚Äìsouth variations in the extratropical zonal wind with centres of action located at approximately 55‚Äì60‚ó¶ and 30‚Äì 35‚ó¶ latitude. The NAM and SAM are largely zonally sym- metric, although NAM is more regionally conÔ¨Åned to the At- lantic sector.\\n\\n6.3 Atlantic variability\\n\\nThe NAM is deÔ¨Åned as the Ô¨Årst empirical orthogonal func- tion (EOF) of the Northern Hemisphere (20‚Äì90‚ó¶ N) win- ter SLP anomalies.

Prior to the EOF analysis the data were weighted by the square root of the cosine of latitude so that equal areas are afforded equal weight. The principal components (PCs) were scaled to unit standard deviation and projected on the original (not area-weighted) data to obtain corresponding EOFs. The leading EOFs shown are associated with a one standard deviation change in the corresponding PCs (index time series).\\n\\nOcean and their adjacent continental regions. Observation- based time series of the AMOC strength is only available since year 2004 (Srokosz et al., 2012), and thus the simula- tion of this circulation in climate models is still important for the understanding of decadal and longer timescale variabil- ity. Medhaug and Furevik (2011) found a large spread in both mean value and variability of the AMOC strength in models contributing to CMIP3.\\n\\nDelworth and Mann (2000) argue for a multidecadal vari- ability with an approximate timescale of 70 yr in proxy- based reconstructions of surface temperature. This variabil- ity is most clearly manifested in the North Atlantic region but with some degree of global expression, and is often re- ferred to as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). Several indices of AMO exist in the literature. The AMO in- dex as deÔ¨Åned by Sutton and Hodson (2005) is shown for the NorESM piControl in Fig. 23a and for HadISST (years 1870‚Äì2011) along with three NorESM historical ensemble members (years 1850‚Äì2005) in Fig. 23b. The standard de- viation of the AMO index in the pre-industrial control of 0.05 K is lower than the standard deviation of 0.14 K for the observation-based index. The larger AMO index standard de- viations of historical experiments (0.07‚Äì0.09 K) compared to the control might be due to the prescribed temporal variabil- ity in the external forcing, an interpretation that is supported by Booth et al. (2012), who found a strong impact of aerosol emissions and volcanic activity on the multidecadal variance\\n\\nThe time series of maximum AMOC strength at 26.5‚ó¶ N in piControl is shown in Fig. 2. The standard deviation of the detrended time series is 0.81 Sv and the associated power spectrum is displayed in Fig. 22. Compared to a Ô¨Åtted red noise process, there is more power on timescales longer than about 25 yr. The power spectrum of maximum AMOC strength at 45‚ó¶ N shows a peak with a timescale of approx- imately 20 yr but with less pronounced multidecadal vari- ability compared to 26.5‚ó¶ N. The evolution of the AMOC strength in the NorESM historical ensemble members and the RCP scenarios is discussed in Iversen et al. (2013).\\n\\nwww.geosci-model-dev.net/6/687/2013/\\n\\nGeosci.

A thorough analysis of the power peak at 20 yr in several time series of the NorESM piControl and the apparent lack of it in the historical experiments is be- yond the scope of this study. An alternate AMO index de- Ô¨Åned by Trenberth and Shea (2006), where the SST anoma- lies between 60‚ó¶ S and 60‚ó¶ N are subtracted from the North Atlantic anomalies, did not change the main Ô¨Åndings of the above discussion.\\n\\n7 Modelled climate evolution of the 20th century\\n\\nA comparison between observed and simulated 2 m air tem- perature (T2m) for the globe and poleward of 60‚ó¶ N is provided in Fig. 24. On a global scale, the three histor- ical members follow observed temperature rather closely. Linear trends for the period 1911‚Äì2010 are 0.077 and 0.063 K decade‚àí1 for the observed (HadCRUT4) and the mean of the three historical NorESM members, respectively. The corresponding trend Ô¨Ågures for the period 1961‚Äì2010 are 0.14 K decade‚àí1 for both observations and model. The simulated magnitude of the recent global warming signal is thus captured by the model.\\n\\nFig. 22.

The AMO index standard deviation of Historical1 is still smaller than the observations indicate, and the multidecadal Ô¨Çuctuations of the observation-based index seem not to be reproduced by the historical experiments. The power spectrum of the AMO index of NorESM piControl in Fig. 23c reveals power around a period of 20 yr that is signiÔ¨Åcantly larger than ex- pected from a red noise process. In contrast to Delworth and Mann (2000), we do not Ô¨Ånd any variability with timescales longer than 30 yr that signiÔ¨Åcantly stands out compared to red noise. The 20 yr peak was also present in the time se- ries of maximum AMOC strength at 45‚ó¶ N, discussed above, and is also evident in a subpolar gyre SSH index shown in Fig. 23c. Thus, it seems likely that the variability with an approximate timescale of 20 yr is associated with north- ern North Atlantic processes possibly involving the sub- polar gyre. Variability in the North Atlantic with similar timescales has been documented in several studies of climate proxies, observations, and climate model simulations (e.g. Frankcombe and Dijkstra, 2009; Frankcombe et al., 2010; Chylek et al., 2011). Further, Escudier et al. (2013) attributed a 20 yr cycle found in the IPSL-CM5A-LR model to a cou- pled oscillatory mode involving propagation of temperature and salinity anomalies in the subpolar gyre, sea ice changes in the Nordic seas, and changes to the strength of the East Greenland Current across the Denmark Strait due to modi- Ô¨Åed regional atmospheric circulation. Interestingly, the peak at 20 yr in NorESM piControl is neither present in any of the NorESM historical ensemble members (Fig. 23d), nor in the HadISST-based index (Fig. 23e). Possible explanations are that variability or trend in the external forcing of the histor- ical experiments either disrupts some feedback mechanism\\n\\nPoleward of 60‚ó¶ N, the linear trends for the last century are now 0.11 and 0.14/0.13/0.13 K decade‚àí1 based on obser- vations and Historical1/Historical2/Historical3, respectively. For the last 50 yr, the corresponding trends are 0.33 and 0.40/0.16/0.20 K decade‚àí1. There is thus a tendency that the simulated recent warming at high northern latitudes is on the weak side compared to HadCRUT4, although Histori- cal1 shows a somewhat stronger warming than the observed one (cyan line in Fig. 24). It is therefore hard to conclude based on this comparison whether the model simulates the observed high-latitude warming realistically. An important factor in this respect is the weak signal-to-noise ratio of sim- ulated surface temperature trends at high northern latitudes (R¬®ais¬®anen, 2001; Sorteberg et al., 2005), potentially masking the warming signal for decades.\\n\\nThe weak high-latitude signal-to-noise ratio is also a pos- sible candidate for the failure of the three historical members to simulate the so-called early warming signal of the 1920s to the 1940s (e.g. Delworth and Knutson, 2000; see lower panel of Fig. 24). A growing body of evidence indicates, however, that the early warming signal can, at least partially, be ex- plained as an interaction between internal generated variabil- ity and external forcings (e.g. OtterÀöa et al., 2010; Ting et al., 2011; Booth et al., 2012). The last hypothesis may indicate that NorESM‚Äôs climate state, likely in the Atlantic‚ÄìArctic sector, prohibits the onset of feedback processes needed to generate high-amplitude variations at high northern latitudes. Candidates for the latter include ventilation of the subpolar North Atlantic (H¬¥at¬¥un et al., 2005; H¬®akkinen and Rhines, 2004), the poleward transport of heat towards the Arctic\\n\\nGeosci.

Clearly, the strong reduction in Arctic summer ice extent observed in the satellite records is not captured in the historical en- semble. Over the years 1979‚Äì2005, the trends in September extent are ‚àí0.59 and ‚àí0.29 mill km2 decade‚àí1 for the ob- served (NSIDC) and NorESM historical ensemble, respec- tively. This shows a delayed melting of sea ice in NorESM during global warming compared with observations. Given that the trend in temperature poleward of 60‚ó¶ N is fairly re- alistic (Fig. 24), the sea ice is not sensitive enough to the temperature increase. As discussed earlier, the ice thickness shown in Fig. 11 is too thick in the east Arctic, north of the Siberian coast, and it is therefore too resistant to summer melt. This thickness maximum is mainly a result of biases in the surface winds. On the other hand, the general thick Arctic sea ice in the model is a result of too little summer melt of snow in the model, giving too little surface melt of the ice.\\n\\nFig. 24.

However, there is a warming tendency in global mean ocean temperature (0.126 K over 500 yr) and this is explained by a small but persistent TOA radiative im- balance with a mean value of about 0.086 W m‚àí2. For the Ô¨Årst few hundred years of the piControl there is a modest freshening tendency of surface SSS with an associated salin- iÔ¨Åcation of the deep ocean. The model‚Äôs fresh water budget diagnosed from global mean evaporation, precipitation, total cloud LWP, sea ice volume and ocean salinity is also in close long-term balance, illustrating the model‚Äôs ability to (closely) conserve heat and fresh water in their modelled forms. The conservation properties of NorESM are encouraging, fulÔ¨Åll- ing a highly desirable constraint for climate models aiming for multidecadal, centennial and longer simulations.\\n\\nLong-term stability of heat and fresh water Ô¨Çuxes between the various model components does, of course, not ensure a model system without biases relative to observation-based estimates. The main model state based on NorESM Histori- cal1, as elaborated in Sect. 5 and Table 1, can be summarised as follows (the comparison is mainly made for the 30 yr pe- riod 1976‚Äì2005):\\n\\n‚Äì The global mean net clear-sky SW and LW Ô¨Çux at TOA, and the associated TOA SW and LW cloud forcing, are close to or within the observational range. This is in con- trast to a clear underestimation of global mean cloud cover. With respect to the radiative Ô¨Çuxes, the overesti- mation of LWP is probably compensating for the bias in cloud cover (Jiang et al., 2012).\\n\\nFig. 25. Time series of (a) Northern and (b) Southern Hemisphere winter and summer sea ice extent from the historical ensemble (red), and two satellite-based estimates for the sea ice extent: the Sea Ice Index in black from NSIDC (Fetterer et al., 2009), and, in grey data, based on the Bootstrap algorithm (Comiso, 1999).\\n\\n‚Äì The simulated annual mean sensible and latent heat Ô¨Çux over land are in the same range as observations, al- though land areas in NorESM are too moist with subse- quently too high latent heat Ô¨Çuxes (Fig. 5). The model underestimates sensible heat Ô¨Çux in most of the African continent south of the Sahara, in the west coast of India, in Australia, and in the western part of the United States, but overestimates sensible heat Ô¨Çux in the extreme east- ern part of South America.\\n\\n8 Summary\\n\\nThe Norwegian Earth System Model in its main grid con- Ô¨Åguration but without interactive carbon cycle, denoted NorESM, is presented, together with a Ô¨Årst-order assessment of the model stability, the mean model state and the internal variability. Further analysis of the model performance is pro- vided in Iversen et al. (2013), presenting CMIP5-type of cli- mate response and scenario projections made with NorESM. Two additional versions of NorESM are available, but not discussed here: a low-resolution version particularly suited for millennium-scale climate studies (Zhang et al., 2012) and the model with interactive carbon cycle (Tjiputra et al., 2013).\\n\\n‚Äì The model generally underestimates the global mean near surface air temperatures over the continents with about 1.1 K. The global mean SST bias is smaller, about ‚àí0.15 K. For the latter, warm biases are found in the major upwelling regions west of the main continents and in the northern North Atlantic (Fig. 12b). The too cold surface model climate might be linked to the inclu- sion of the aerosol indirect effect in NorESM, a slight overestimation of the cooling by the aerosol direct ef- fect (KirkevÀöag et al., 2013), and too extensive summer sea ice extent (Figs. 3 and 4).\\n\\nNorESM is based on the CCSM4 (Gent et al., 2011; Vertenstein et al., 2010), but differs from the latter by, in par- ticular, an isopycnic coordinate ocean model (see Sect. 2.4) and chemistry‚Äìaerosol‚Äìcloud‚Äìradiation interaction schemes developed for the Oslo version of the Community Atmo- sphere Model (CAM4-Oslo; see Sect. 2.1 and KirkevÀöag et al., 2013).\\n\\nAs shown in Fig. 2 and elaborated in Sect. 4, the long-term model drift in NorESM is generally small, exempliÔ¨Åed with linear trends for the 500 yr long piControl of global mean surface temperature and SST of 0.039 K and 0.031 K over\\n\\n‚Äì The\\n\\ntoo low (‚àí0.15 g kg‚àí1), with negative biases covering most of the low latitudes and large positive biases (> 2 g kg‚àí1) in the Arctic Ocean (Fig. 12d).\\n\\nsimulated global mean SSS is\\n\\nGeosci.

Bentsen et al.: The Norwegian Earth System Model, NorESM1-M\\n\\n713\\n\\n‚Äì The simulated AMOC is on the strong side (30.8 Sv at 26.5‚ó¶ N, Fig. 13b) compared to observation-based esti- mates and other model simulations. This bias leads to a too warm (Fig. 14b) and saline (Fig. 14d) Atlantic Ocean at depth. It is not clear which mechanisms are responsible for the strong AMOC in NorESM.\\n\\n‚Äì The global mean SSH is comparable to observations, although the SSH of the Atlantic Ocean is too low (Fig. 12f).\\n\\n‚Äì NorESM simulates a northward oceanic heat trans- port of 0.6 PW at equator, in contrast to a vanish- ing heat transport based on observation-based estimates (Fig. 15a). North of the equator, the simulated north- ward oceanic heat transport is too large in all ocean basins. The bias is particularly evident in the Atlantic Ocean, likely linked to the overly strong AMOC.\\n\\n‚Äì NorESM overestimates the oceanic evaporation by about 4 % and the Ô¨Çux of water vapour from ocean to land by about 8 %. The atmospheric residence time of oceanic water vapour is, however, consistent with ob- servations.\\n\\n‚Äì The main power of the NINO3.4 index of Historical1 occurs on timescales of 2‚Äì4 yr, whereas observations (HadISST) covering the period 1900‚Äì2005 show a peak on 3‚Äì7 yr (Fig. 17). The standard deviation of Histori- cal1 (and piControl) is approximately 15 % larger than in the observations. On decadal and longer timescales, piControl has less power compared to both HadISST and Historical1, possibly because of the absence of natural forcings in piControl. The spatial correlations of NINO3.4 SST anomalies with global SST anoma- lies in Historical1 and HadISST shares many features (Fig. 18), although the model produces a too narrow cor- relation pattern in the tropical PaciÔ¨Åc east of 160‚ó¶ E and a too weak horse-shoe shaped pattern of negative corre- lation in the sub-tropical PaciÔ¨Åc.\\n\\n‚Äì Analysis of\\n\\nthe Madden‚ÄìJulian oscillation shows that NorESM is able to produce coherent eastward- propagating waves in the intraseasonal zonal winds and OLR over the tropical Indian and PaciÔ¨Åc Oceans. This is particularly the case for wavenumber 1 in the 30‚Äì80 day band, whereas the model fails to simulate the strong co- herency for wavenumbers 2‚Äì3 found in observations.\\n\\n‚Äì Cloudiness in NorESM is underestimated by between 13 to 24 % (relative to ISCCP and CLOUDSAT data, re- spectively). The liquid water in clouds is generally ex- aggerated, particularly in the extratropical storm track regions (cf. Jiang et al., 2012).\\n\\n‚Äì A comparison between the simulated and observation- based Northern and Southern Annular Modes shows a close resemblance for the SAM, whereas the simu- lated NAM has larger amplitudes over the Arctic and North PaciÔ¨Åc and the Atlantic centres of action are shifted to the east (Fig. 21).\\n\\n‚Äì The magnitude of tropical precipitation is clearly over- estimated in the model (Fig. 7e and f), a problem related to the well-known double ITCZ problem also present in NorESM (Fig. 8).\\n\\n‚Äì The zonally averaged mean troposphere temperature is in general too cold in both summer and winter (Fig. 9). The strength and seasonal migration of the Northern Hemisphere tropospheric jets are well captured by the model (Fig. 10), although the Northern Hemisphere subtropical and eddy-driven jets are slightly more sep- arated during DJF, and the Southern Hemisphere sub- tropical jet is too strong during DJF.\\n\\n‚Äì In piControl, the power spectrum of simulated max- imum AMOC strength at 26.5‚ó¶ N show more power compared to a theoretical red noise spectrum on timescales longer than 25 yr. However, at 45‚ó¶ N the maximum AMOC strength has a power peak at about 20 yr. The strong variability at 20 yr timescale is also seen in the AMO index and in a subpolar gyre SSH in- dex, and thus is likely associated with northern North Atlantic processes (Fig. 23c). This 20 yr peak is ab- sent in the AMO index of the three historical experi- ments as well as in HadISST (Fig. 23), indicating that the external forcing of the historical experiments may disrupt some feedback mechanism causing the signal in the control simulation.\\n\\n‚Äì The simulated geographic distribution of sea ice is fairly realistic, although with too extensive extents in both hemispheres during the respective summer seasons (Figs. 4 and 11). The simulated sea ice thickness is, in general, comparable to or on the thick side compared to available observations.\\n\\nFor the climate evolution of the 20th century, the follow- ing results are presented (see Iversen et al., 2013, for a more comprehensive discussion of the contemporary and future climate simulated with NorESM):\\n\\nAn analysis of the simulated internal variability of the NorESM piControl and historical ensemble experiments, fo- cussing on tropical variability, the annular modes and At- lantic variability, shows the following features (Sect. 6):\\n\\n‚Äì On global scale, the three historical members match the evolution of the observed surface temperature for the last 100 and 50 yr (Fig. 24a), with a warming of +0.14 K decade‚àí1 in both observations and model for the latter period. None of the historical members\\n\\nwww.geosci-model-dev.net/6/687/2013/\\n\\nGeosci. Model Dev., 6, 687‚Äì720, 2013\\n\\n714\\n\\nM. Bentsen et al.: The Norwegian Earth System Model, NorESM1-M\\n\\nsimulate the early warming signal of the 1920s to the 1940s poleward of 60‚ó¶ N (Fig. 24b).\\n\\n‚Äì For the Arctic sea ice, the simulated melting rate dur- ing summer is about half of the observed rate since the late 1970s. Also the simulated winter melting lags the observed melting (Fig. 25a). The too slow melting in the model is likely linked to the too thick sea ice in the model, particularly north of the Siberian coast. For the Antarctic (Fig. 25b), both observations and the model show changes since the late 1970s that are either in- signiÔ¨Åcant or on the borderline of being signiÔ¨Åcant, so no conclusions can be made based on trends.\\n\\nA detailed comparison between the parent model CCSM4 and NorESM is beyond the scope of this paper. However, a few notable differences between the two model systems can be mentioned:\\n\\n‚Äì The net TOA radiative imbalance in the pre-industrial integrations is smaller in NorESM than in\\n\\ncontrol CCSM4.\\n\\n‚Äì The global mean near surface air\\n\\ntemperature of NorESM is lower compared to CCSM4 during the last few decades of the 20th century experiments, with CCSM4 being closer to observations. However, the tem- perature increase during the historic experiment seems more realistic in NorESM compared to CCSM4 with CCSM4 warming faster than observations, particularly during the last 30‚Äì40 yr (see Sect. 7 and Gent et al., 2011). A considerable part of this difference might be explained by the inclusion of the aerosol indirect effect in NorESM.\\n\\ncompared to the 2‚ó¶ version of CCSM4. Furthermore, NorESM‚Äôs ITCZ bias is mainly conÔ¨Åned to the North- ern Hemisphere while the bias in CCSM4 is more sym- metric about the equator. This difference may, in part, originate from the aerosol direct and indirect effects in NorESM (Sect. 5.2).\\n\\nThe readers are referred to Iversen et al. (2013) for further\\n\\nanalysis of NorESM.\\n\\nAcknowledgements.
